# Alexa Rank

A simple [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) extension to quickly get a site's Alexa ranking.

## Usage

You must have the [PowerPack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) to use this extension.

Download [Alexa Rank.alfredextension](https://github.com/downloads/brickattack/AlexaRank/Alexa%20Rank.alfredextension) and open it. It should open with Alfred and prompt you to accept some options.

Once installed, activate Alfred and use keyword `alx` (or the keyword you chose) then input the URL of the site you want to rank.

* example `alx alfredapp.com`
